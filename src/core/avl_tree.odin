  AVL Tree
    -> Self-balancing binary search tree
    -> Named after Adelson-Velsky and Landis
    -> Similar to red-black trees
    -> Perform fixes after insert and delete
      -> Height balanced
    -> Guarantess specific time complexities for operations
      -> O(log n) - search , insert and delete

  Height = number of nodes on the longest path from the root to a leaf
